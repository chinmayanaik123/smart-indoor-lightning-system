The design goal of this lighting control system is to achieve required illumination condition with low energy consumption by making use of daylight or it can also be referred to as Day light harvesting. By measuring the available daylight by light sensors, the required intensity of light is given to attain the required illumination when and where it is needed. For most part of the day we obtain sunlight and with some improvisation it is possible to use it effectively. Hence this method reduces energy consumption and costs. As electricity is produced from non-renewable sources, it is everyoneâ€™s responsibility to use it wisely.
